### Implementation Features

Analytics+ implements IBCS standards through:

#### Semantic Color Coding

Analytics+ implements the IBCS semantic notation through consistent visual encoding:

- **Actuals (AC)**: Solid dark colors (typically dark blue/black)
- **Plan/Budget (PL)**: Outlined shapes in the same color
- **Forecast (FC)**: Hatched pattern in the same color
- **Previous Period (PY)**: Lighter shade of the same color
- **Positive Variances**: Standard green
- **Negative Variances**: Standard red
- **Structural Elements**: Neutral grays
- **Highlighting**: Accent colors for emphasis

This semantic encoding extends beyond simple color choices to include:

- **Fill Patterns**: Solid, outlined, and hatched patterns to distinguish between actuals, plan, and forecast
- **Line Styles**: Solid lines for actuals, dashed lines for plans and forecasts
- **Shape Consistency**: Maintaining consistent shapes across different scenarios
- **Variance Indicators**: Standardized visual elements for variance representation
- **Customizable Standards**: Ability to adjust colors while maintaining pattern distinctions
