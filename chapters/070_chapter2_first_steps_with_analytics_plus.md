## Assign Data

For starters, you can assign the Axis and Values visual parameters. We've added a Small Multiples parameter in Card and Table mode to demonstrate the trellis feature in Analytics+. The parameters are the same for Chart, Card, and Table mode, but Gantt requires a different set of input parameters. Based on the data assigned, Analytics+ will create a default visualization. You can then customize and tailor the visual to suit your specific requirements.
